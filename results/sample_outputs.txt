(CNN) I see signs of a revolution everywhere. I see it in the op-ed pages of the newspapers, and on the state ballots in nearly half the country. I see it in politicians who once preferred to play it safe with this explosive issue but are now willing to stake their political futures on it. I see the revolution in the eyes of sterling scientists, previously reluctant to dip a toe into this heavily stigmatized world, who are diving in head first. I see it in the new surgeon general who cites data showing just how helpful it can be. I see a revolution in the attitudes of everyday Americans. For the first time a majority, 53%, favor its legalization, with 77% supporting it for medical purposes. Support for legalization has risen 11 points in the past few years alone. In 1969, the first time Pew asked the question about legalization, only 12% of the nation was in favor. I see a revolution that is burning white hot among young people, but also shows up among the parents and grandparents in my kids' school. A police officer I met in Michigan is part of the revolution, as are the editors of the medical journal, Neurosurgery. I see it in the faces of good parents, uprooting their lives to get medicine for their children -- and in the children themselves, such as Charlotte, who went from having 300 seizures a week to just one or two a month. We know it won't consistently have such dramatic results (or any impact at all) in others, but what medicine does? I see this medical marijuana revolution in surprising places. Girl's seizures spur medical marijuana legislation in Georgia . Among my colleagues, my patients and my friends. I have even seen the revolution in my own family. A few years ago, when I told my mother I was investigating the topic for a documentary, I was met with a long pause. "Marijuana...?" She whispered in a half questioning, half disapproving tone. She could barely even say the word and her response filled me with self-doubt. Even as a grown man, mom can still make my cheeks turn red and shatter my confidence with a single word. But just last week she suddenly stopped mid-conversation and said, "I am proud of you on the whole marijuana thing." I waited for the other shoe to drop, but it didn't. Instead, she added, "You probably helped a lot of people who were suffering." I don't think we had ever had a conversation like that one. At that moment, I saw a revolution that can bring you to tears. The word revolution, comes from the Latin revolutio, to "turn around." I had my own turn around a couple of years ago, and at the time it was a lonely place to hold a supportive position on medical marijuana. Hardly any government officials would agree to sit down and be interviewed on the topic. Even patients I spoke to were reluctant to share their stories. It can be tricky, I learned, to be on the right side of science but on the wrong side of ideology. When we put the first "Weed" documentary on television in August 2013, I didn't know if anyone would watch our yearlong investigation. Even worse, I didn't even know if they would care. Is weed legal in your state? Just two years later, in "Weed 3," we are eyewitnesses to a revolution in full swing. You will ride along with us for the dawn of the first federally approved clinical study on the use of marijuana for PTSD. You will meet patients such as Sean Kiernan, an accomplished investment banker, and Amelia Taylor, a stay-at-home mom. They are the remarkable and surprising faces of this r

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie wasn't looking too presidential Tuesday night when he got into a heated debate with a veteran teacher at a town hall meeting. And now the state's largest teacher's union is calling him out for his 'bullying' behavior. 'He's always taken a very nasty and disrespectful tone with teachers and other individuals who dare to question him at these events,' Steve Wollmer of the NJ Education Association told NJ.com. 'It's the one thing that never seems to change.' Scroll Down for Video . Not being nice: New Jersey Gov Chris Christie (left) is being called a bully for the way he interacted with a teacher (Kathy Mooney, right) at a Tuesday night town hall meeting . That sentiment doesn't ring well with Christie's ambitions to run in the Republican presidential primaries next year. Tuesday night, Christie appeared at Kenilworth Town Hall to take questions from a group of citizens, when Kathy Mooney, a high school English Teacher from Roselle Park, took the microphone. Ms Mooney, who has been a teacher for 27 years, questioned Christie's motivations behind a legal settlement with oil company ExxonMobil which could have contributed drastically to the state's pension plans for teachers. Christie settled the deal for $225million, despite the fact that the state had originally asked for $8.9billion which Mooney described as 'favoring the affluent' and 'kicking state workers under the bus'. 'I know that you could have gotten more money, on the dollar,' Mooney said. 'Do you?' a defensive Christie quickly responded. 'You do know that? Really? You know that?' Mooney started to respond, but not before being cut off by the governor. A good deal? Mooney questioned Christie's decision-making behind a $225million legal settlement. The state originally wanted $8.9billion from the oil company, and Mooney says that would have had a huge impact on pensions for public employees . 'I mean: Do you know that?' Christie continued. 'I wanna know how you know that. Because you're a teacher, and you're standing in front of students every day, conveying to them, facts - things that they need to learn. So I would like to understand your analysis of how you know that in a ten year long, court case, that you have enough detail to know.' Mooney explains that she read about the deal in the newspaper and did not attend the meeting 'to be bullied'. 'You're not being bullied, because you're asking me a question, I'm going to ask you questions back,' Christie says, as he continues to dodge the issue. 'He said, "I'm not bullying you' as he bullied her,"' Wollmer said of the exchange. Perhaps the reason why Wollmer and his union responded sharply to Christie's town hall meeting Tuesday night, is that he blamed the union for their role in the current pension system. 'The fact is your union, over the course of time, has asked for significantly higher benefits - more expensive benefits - that your union knew the state could not afford,' Christie said Tuesday.

YouTube star Cassey Ho has hit back at critics with a powerful and provocative new video, highlighting the cruel comments left by viewers of her fitness-focused clips who accuse the trim and toned online icon of being everything from ‘too fat’ to ‘ugly’ to ‘pudgy’. Cassey's YouTube channel, Blogilates, has over two million subscribers, so fans may have been surprised to learn that the negative comments left under the California resident’s fitness videos still manage to get under her skin – and have a much greater impact on her than any of the positive messages sent to her by her fans. But though mean and critical messages may have put a dent in the 28-year-old’s self-esteem, the workout pro is getting the last word with her latest video, The 'Perfect' Body, which examines just whether conforming to society's standards is the key to happiness, while highlighting some of the cruel comments she has received from viewers of her YouTube videos. Scroll down for video. Fighting back: In her new video, Pilates instructor and YouTube star Cassey Ho combats body-shamers who comment on her videos . She's only human: Seemingly full of confidence, Cassey said even she has felt bad about herself after reading nasty comments calling her 'fat' online . In a post on her Blogilates blog, Cassey said negative comments on her videos are nothing new, but the flood of nastiness has grown especially bad lately. She added that the trash-talking has even brought her to tears on more than one occasion. 'It’s hard to be content with the shape of your body when people are constantly telling you how fat you are, how much weight you need to lose, how much weight you need to gain,' she wrote. 'What do people want?' Cassey goes on to explain that, through her new video, fans can see what it's like to face that kind of negativity, and watch as her own self-esteem gets 'stripped away', leaving her feeling insecure and ashamed about her appearance. Fit or fat: The slim and toned blogger says that the negativity in the comments section of her YouTube channel has become especially nasty lately, and has even made her cry . Peanut gallery problems: In the new video, Cassey picks at her body, honing in on places that commenters say she could improve upon . The video begins with Cassey posting a selfie in gym clothes, taken just after a workout. She immediately starts to read the comments, and though they start off positive, soon people are telling her she shouldn't give fitness advice because she is fat. Cassey goes on to strip down to her underwear, examining, pinching and prodding her body, using the spiteful comments to direct her to different parts of her physique that people insist need changing. And as the video goes on, she grows more unsatisfied with herself as negative comments pop up around her. So the YouTube star gets to work, manipulating her body in a simulation of real-life Photoshop. She thins her thighs, hips, and waist, makes her butt and chest bigger, and even changes the color of her eyes. Finally, she posts another selfie of her 'improved' look - achieved with the help of a body double - but she is clearly still unhappy, and she uses this feeling to try and show viewers that giving in to body-shaming will only leave you worse off. Before and after: The fitness expert's body goes under a major transformation; Cassey used a body double to achieve the final look .

Dorset-born Cook, 24, who was overlooked for the Great Britain taekwondo squad at London 2012, applied for citizenship after receiving funding from Moldovan billionaire Igor Iuzefovici and has now received his passport from the small eastern European state. 'I will soon begin a new journey representing the Republic of Moldova at all International competitions and hopefully the Rio Olympic games and beyond, should I qualify,' Cook wrote on his Facebook page. Three time European champion Aaron Cook (right) has refused to fight for Great Britain  since May 2012 . The British taekwondo star has been granted citizenship by Moldova and plans to fight for them in Rio 2016 . 'Although I am upset and disappointed I will not represent my country of birth at another major championships, I felt I had no other option. 'I am a fighter at heart and I am not going to throw away 20 years of dedication because of bureaucracy.' Cook, who fought for Team GB at Beijing 2008, felt he was overlooked for London 2012 - when Lutalo Muhammad, who was selected instead, won bronze - because he decided to quit the British programme in 2011. Cook is aggrieved at being overlooked in favour of Lutalo Muhammad, who won bronze at London 2012 . GB Taekwondo has always denied this, but Cook has refused to compete under the British flag since May 2012 and has fought for the Isle of Man since early 2013. 'It has been an amazing couple of years full of memories, and I would have loved to continue competing under the Isle of Man banner,' Cook said. 'Unfortunately that was never going to be possible as it was made clear to me in May of last year, after winning the European Championships for the third consecutive time, that it would not be possible for me to be selected for Team GB, regardless of my world ranking or performances. Cook competes against Mauro Sarmiento at the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008 . 'Having received no funding or support from the GB system and financing myself since June 2011, this was not a situation that was acceptable to me and I did not want to put myself, family, friends, supporters or sport through the same situation we were forced to endure at the London 2012 Olympic Games.' Cook hopes to represent Moldova for the first time at the inaugural Baku European Games in June having served the mandatory three-year period since representing a previous country. However, the British Olympic Association could yet block the move and Sportsmail understands it is still in talks over the matter.

Walcott was replaced by Ross Barkley after just 55 minutes of England's 1-1 draw against Italy on Tuesday . 2 - Premier League goals for Walcott this season - his average haul per season during his time at Arsenal is 5.6. It was the latest disappointment in a difficult season for the 26-year-old, who has struggled for game time since returning from a long-term lay-off due to a serious knee injury. With Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain out of Liverpool’s visit due to a hamstring strain, and Danny Welbeck a major doubt after sustaining a knee problem on international duty, Walcott could start on Saturday. But Wenger said: ‘Yes, I’m worried about Theo’s confidence. He’s sensitive and I’m a bit concerned about the damage that game can have on his mind. Walcott could face Liverpool on Saturday with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain injured and Danny Welbeck a doubt . ‘He’s not completely there yet (after the injury). But being exposed like that, people have a harsh judgement on him that is not deserved because he does well. ‘At the moment he is frustrated, but that is normal. I will speak with him, but I think he is strong enough. ‘I will see what state of mind he is in. We always have a word, if it is a positive experience or a negative experience, you ask “how did it go?”. We always speak about the last game. ‘He is not fragile mentally, he is strong mentally but he is disappointed because when you come back from an injury you always think you are ready. ‘He needs patience. He is at the moment not in his best mood. ‘He has big confidence in himself and he has gone through some difficult periods in his life and he has always come out with strength.’ Arsenal boss Wenger says he will speak with Walcott but believes the Gunners winger is 'strong enough' Walcott found himself playing in the No 10 role for England in Turin — a role he is not accustomed to. And Wenger admitted he was surprised to see the pacy forward in such an unfamiliar position. ‘Have I ever seen him play No 10 in training or anything? No,’ said Wenger. ‘Theo’s strength is the quality of his movements, he wants to go to get on the end of things. He’s not a guy who provides. ‘I don’t think it was the intention of Roy Hodgson to play him there. It’s maybe because Wayne Rooney took the initiative during the game to play higher up and tell Theo to drop back. ‘I didn’t see Roy Hodgson in the game stand up to say “Walcott, you come and play in midfield and Rooney you go up front”. That’s an initiative they took on the pitch.’ Walcott aims a shot at goal during England's friendly against Italy at the Juventus Stadium in Turin . Walcott was starting his first international game in 18 months having injured his cruciate ligaments . Meanwhile, Wenger insists there are fundamental flaws in FA chairman Greg Dyke’s proposal to increase the number of required homegrown players in Premier League squads to 12.

'My name is Abu Yusuf. I made hijrah from Australia to the Islamic State to live under the khilafah,’ he says. 'I saw this as part of my jihad for Islam, to help the Muslim Ummah (community) in the area that I could which is the medical field.' He claims to be sad he delayed travelling to Syria for so long. ‘It is disappointing to think how many fellow Muslims brothers and sisters in the medical field, who are doctors and nurses, physios, who are still living in the West and unfortunately the Muslims living here are suffering, not necessary from a lack of equipment or medicine but a mainly a lack of qualified medical care.'

As Prime Minister David Cameron puts it, on St George’s Day  we should ‘celebrate everything it is to be English’. But what does it mean to be English? From the Romans, Saxons and Normans many hundreds of years ago to those from Africa, the Indian sub-continent and the Philippines today, England has always been shaped by migration. To mark St George’s Day today, with a little help from WorldRemit, FEMAIL reveals the seemingly very English things that have actually been brought to England by people from abroad - and you may be surprised by the origins of your favourite things. Scroll down for video . Fish and chips has become a  British institution, as well as a national money-spinner, but it is actually believed to be partly Portuguese and partly Belgian . FISH AND CHIPS . They're a British institution as well as a national money-spinner, but how much do we really know about fish and chips? For most of us, the classic combination of battered fish and chipped potatoes deep-fried in beef fat or vegetable oil is as English as the cup of tea that washes it down. But just as tea originates in India or China, fish and chips is partly Portuguese and partly Belgian. The British can take credit for uniting these two Continental imports and creating a coupling that is loved the world over. One hundred and fifty years ago, in 1860, on the streets of the East End of London, 13-year-old Jewish boy called Joseph Malin had the bright idea of combining fried fish with chips. Joseph's family were rug weavers. To increase the family income they had begun frying chips in a downstairs room of their house. It was Joseph's idea to combine the chips - at that point a novelty in London - with fish from a nearby fried fish shop. Fried fish already had a long history in London. In a letter written at the end of the 18th Century, future American President Thomas Jefferson described eating 'fried fish in the Jewish fashion' on a visit to the capital. Battered fried fish had first arrived in London 200 years earlier with Jewish refugees from Portugal and Spain. They brought with them a way of cooking fish that would eventually become as British as Sherlock Holmes. The actual origins of polo are unclear but historians are convinced it originated in Persia or amongst the Iranian tribes of Central Asia and was introduced to Brits by locals in the Indian state of Assam . By the 1830s, the imported novelty had established itself firmly as a favourite among London's poor. It was tasty, cheap and filling and could be eaten hot or cold. In 1846, a Jewish cookbook published in London included a recipe for fried fish. Eight years later, A Shilling Cookery For The People by French chef Alexis Soyer contained the first printed recipe for 'fried cooked potatoes'. The seal of respectability came when Victorian cook Eliza Acton, the forerunner of Mrs Beeton, suggested eating fried fish with vinegar to sweeten the taste. No one knows exactly how and where chips first originated. The most popular story credits a poor Belgian housewife from the Meuse Valley with their invention. In the winter of 1680, the river froze. Unable to get hold of any fish for her family, she cut potatoes into fish shapes and fried them instead. POLO .

A 13-year-old Indian girl faced with an arranged marriage has written a letter to her teacher begging her to stop the wedding (stock image above) A 13-year-old Indian girl faced with an arranged marriage has written a letter to her teacher begging her to stop the wedding. Duli Hembrom wrote to the principal of Milan Mithi Uchha Vidyalaya after failing to convince her parents to call off the wedding, which is due to take place in two days. She wrote: 'I do not want to get married, I took an oath at the time of admission that I will not get married before I turn 18.' She added that she wanted the teacher to stop the marriage 'whichever way possible', the India Times reported. It is thought the 'oath' Duli refers to is the school's promise she had to make when she started, but exactly what it included is not known. Her father Lachhu, who lives in Gudibanda with Duli's mother, said child marriage was a common phenomenon in their society. He told the Hindustan Times that it was difficult to find a suitable match for a grown-up girl. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, passed in India during British rule in 1929, specified that a girl must be 18 and a boy 21 before they can wed. But the country has the second highest number of child marriages, according to a UN report. Nearly 52 per cent of girls are married before reaching 18 years old, Indian records show. Between 2011 and 2020 more than 140 million girls will become child brides globally, analysts estimate. Aarati Benera, a women’s rights activist, described child marriage as 'illegal and a social evil'.

Above, women and girls sit waiting to be married in a mass wedding ceremony in India . Despite numerous campaigns from many of the world's largest charities and NGOs, the issue of child brides remains a global concern. In 2013 there were around 57.5 million child brides across the world, 40 per cent of which married in India. This is despite the Child Marriage Restraint Act, passed  during British rule in 1929, specifying that a girl must be 18 and a boy 21 before they can wed. Meanwhile, in Africa, 42 per cent of girls were married before turning 18 compared to 29 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean. The number of child brides is estimated to rise to 140 million by 2020 if current trends continue, 18.5 million of which will be under 15 years old, analysts warn. Statistics show that girls living in poor households are almost twice as likely to marry before 18 than girls in higher income households. And girls younger than 15 are also five times more likely to die in childbirth than women in their 20s. Aarati Benera, a women’s rights activist, described child marriage as 'illegal and a social evil'.
